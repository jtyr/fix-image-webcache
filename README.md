Fix Image WebCache
==================

If you see broken images in your Gmail inbox, it could be caused
by images pointing to your internal web server (e.g. Jira system) which
Google is trying to cache. This extension helps to remove the Google
image web cache and point the images directly to the web server.

The extension will only work if you can open the images from your browser
(i.e. you are connected to the internal network).

This extension can be installed from [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fix-image-webcache/koimnfpoocfeklhjnkekpbdfniimfmpn "Chrome Web Store").
